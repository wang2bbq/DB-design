Assumptions:

1. The dental practice staff comprises two types: front office workers and doctors. Front office worker and doctor are disjoint subtypes of the staff supertype, with no other subtypes present.

2. Create the "Billing Submission" entity to illustrate the process by which the owners bill insurance providers.

3. Three expense-related entities exist: "Loan Repayment", "Salary Expense", and "Monthly Expense". Considering that lease, supplies restocking, and operating costs are incurred monthly, the "Monthly Expense" entity captures these recurring expenditures.

4. For owners, the "Daily Schedule" entity can track and manage the day's schedule. Additionally, the "Billing Record" entity provides insights into the billable income generated through the day's services.

5. The entities "Billing Record", "Loan Repayment", "Salary Expense", and "Monthly Expense" assist owners in evaluating profit or loss.
